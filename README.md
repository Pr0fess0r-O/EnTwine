#Title</br>
Twine Poetry Examples from "Let Me Count the Ways: Twine as (an Introduction to) [Digital] Poetry" by Calvin Olsen
  
##About</br>
This simple repository contains two examples of Twine poetry from my chapter in <i>EnTwine</i>: an exploded sonnet and a Twi-ku. Both of these examples were included in the chapter, so this repository allows you to see the poems in action, so to speak. 
I have no plans to modify these from where they currently stand, but I will try to include future Twine poems on my main GitHub repository.

##Getting Started</br>
Both of these examples are included here as HTML files, so when you pull them up on GitHub you can see the code in full, and if you download the file and run it you will see the "final" version of the poem.
 
</br>###Prerequisites</br>
None. Simply view/copy the code in GitHub and/or download the raw file to see the finalized poem.
 
###Built with Twine (suggest Notepad++ for changing code)

###Opening these files</br>
To open these files in a browser (which will take you to the final product), simply download to your computer and open them. 

##Sharing</br>
I invite any and all to fork, download, and/or adapt these resources. 
I would also be thrilled to recieve Twine poems from anyone who chooses to try these or others. Feel free to reach out any time via the author info below or the Contact tab on my website (calvin-olsen.com).
